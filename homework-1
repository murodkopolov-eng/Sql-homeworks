------EASY

------1)Define the following terms:data,database,relational database, and table.

------1.Data=Data refers to raw, factual information, such as numbers, text, images, and videos, that can be recorded and processed by a computer. 
------2.Database=Database is the thing that we will be able to find collection of data electronically.
------3.Relational database=A relational database organizes into one or more tables with predefined relationships between them.
------4.Table=In table function the data will be organized into rows and into columns.

------2)List five key features of SQL server.

------1.High Availability and Disaster Recovery.
------2.Scalability and Performance.
------3.High security.
------4.Business intelligence (BI) support.
------5.Comprehensive Management and Development Tools.

------3)What are the different authentication modes available when connecting to SQL Server? (Give at least 2)

------1.Windows Authentication Mode.
------2.SQL Server Authentication.

------MEDIUM.

------4)Create a new database in SSMS named SchoolDB.

------create database SchoolDB
------select * from sys.databases

------5)Write and execute a query to create a table called Students with columns:StudentID(INT,PRIMARY KEY),Name VARCHAR(50),Age INT

------create table Students (id int,name varchar(50),age int)
------select * from Students
------insert into Students values (1,'Murod','18')
------select * from Students
------insert into Students values (1,'Xojinazar','22')
------insert into Students values (1,'Otabek','19')
------select * from Students

------6)Describe the differences SQL Server,SSMS, and SQL.

------1.SQL(Structured Query Language)=This is the special programmimg language that can manage and manipulate relational databases,with this programming language we can find any data we want to use.
------SQL is used for tasks such as creating and modifying database schemas, inserting, updating, and deleting data, and querying data for retrieval.
------2.SSMS(SQL Server Management Studio)=Managing and controlling databases of SQL namely creating a database,editing,delating,writing requests and using them.

------HARD

------7)Research and explain the differnt SQL commands:DQL,DML,DDL,DCL,TCL with examples.

------1.DQL(Data Query Language)=The main aim working in this programming language that is to find specific data from a database which is based on a certain criteria.The SELECT command is the primary command of DQL.
------2.DML(Data Manipulation Language)=This programming language is also the category of SQL with the help of DML we can update,delete our data.Also update is for give some changes for available data,and delete removing rows,insert for adding new rows, and select to check available data.
------3.DDL(Data Definition Language= a subset of SQL used to define, create, and modify the structure of database objects such as tables, indices, and views. Common DDL commands include CREATE (to build new objects), ALTER (to change existing objects), and DROP (to delete objects). 
------4.DCL(Data Control Language)=The main objectuve of this programming language is to control variety of data.
------5.TCL( Transaction Control Language)=TCL is used to manage and control transactions within a database.

----8)Write a query to insert three records into Student table.
----select * from Students

----update Students
----SET id=2
----where age=22
----update Students 
----set id=3
----where age=19
----insert into Students values (4,'Xursandbek','12')
----insert into Students values (5,'Shoxjahon','7')
----insert into Students values (6,'Tamara','7')
--select * from Students
